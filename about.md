I am a PhD student at the University of Newcastle. I am working on conic optimisation solvers for large sparse mixed semidefinite quadratic linear programs (SQLP) that arise in finite element limit analysis (FELA).

I will record details here of some efficient implementations of numerical methods and discuss whatever else I decide interesting or important enough to spend time writing about.
